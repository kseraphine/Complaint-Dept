## Project Description:
The Complaint Department will be a website to help cheer up users based on their complaint of the day.

Users will enter the index page and select from a predefined list of categories which will include Weather, Family, Job, and School. Each category contains a list of a few preselected complaints and an option add a complaint.

When the user selects a complaint, a photo, video, or meme will will display showing content related to the complaint. The media will be funny in nature and is meant to make the user feel better. After each round of media displayed, the user will be asked if they feel better. If the user selects no, another photo or video will be displayed. If the user selects yes, a funny message will display showing the seriousness of the complaint. In example, if user feels better after the initial media, then the problem was not that big. A funny message will display like “That’s small potatoes. There are children starving out there.”.

If the user’s problem is not available under the category, then they can add a complaint. When adding a complaint, the user is prompted to include a short complaint description and keywords that will be used to search for related media. The problem will then be added to the category and the media will begin to display.
